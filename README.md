# Running

You need `python3` installed. 

1. `pip3 install discord`
2. `python3 run.py`
3. Paste the special code provided by frodakcin

## If you don't have Python 3.6

If you are running Python 3.7, make sure that you have Python 3.6 (if you don't, you need to download Python 3.6). You can try then running `python3.6`. If that does not work, then you need to somehow delete Python 3.7 to run the program. 

Python 3.5 should work as well for running the program, but we don't test the bot to see if it will.
